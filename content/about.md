Welcome, I'm Thomas Zahner and this is my blog and website.
I'm a software engineer and I'm into Rust ðŸ¦€ and FOSS.
I completed my B.Sc. in Computer Science at [Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences](https://www.ost.ch/en/) in 2024.
When I'm not sitting in front of the computer, you can find me on the climbing wall, doing other sporting activities or making music.

I'm on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@thomas_zahner), [GitHub](https://github.com/thomas-zahner) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/thomas-zahner).
You can also contact me [by email](mailto:thomas.zahner@protonmail.ch).

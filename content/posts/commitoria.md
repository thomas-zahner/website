Git is a fully distributed version control system. [^1]


This means when people check out a git repository they store a fully local copy.
There are no locking mechanisms in git.

working on a project with git, users cl

everybody stores a full copy of the project they are working on on their computer.
There are no locking 

today this decentralisation might be the natural, obvious choice to developers, however git's predecessors used a contralised approach.

# History lesson

The narrative of decentralised software runs through the whole world of software.
The World Wide Web and Email might be the two most prominent examples of decentralised systems.

Finally, [Tim Berners-Lee] insisted that the system should be decentralized without any central control or coordination over the creation of links. (Wiki on www)

Email has been deadnamed multiple times in the past but it probably won't cease to exist any time soon.
Its ubiquity might be part of the reason. But the reason it became ubiquitous in the first place might have been because of its federated/decentralised/distributed nature.

RSS: ...
However, as many people today don't know RSS or might only vaguely remember it we should question what happened.
The decline in popularity of RSS hints at the fact that there might be appealing alternatives.

# The threats to decentralisation

- Common scheme: centralisation is the right way. Corporate interests pop up -> centralisation.
Example email: fully decentralised -> Gmail, Outlook try to centralise it again
Example messanger: WhatsApp used to support XMPP. Then they removed support for it to destroy interoperability. Now the EU forced them to make them interoperable again under the Digital Markets Act

- Social media: ActivityPub used by Mastodon. Facebook/Meta introduced threads.
But critics

Anti-Meta Fedipact
Signatories believe that Meta will employ an "embrace, extend, and extinguish" strategy and become an existential threat to the fediverse, with many criticizing Meta's moderation practices. (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66155433.amp)

# Fediversity?

decentralisation -> federation

- GitHub bans projects for no apparent reason: https://mastodon.social/@organicmaps/114233788700982882
  GitHub corporate funded, AI experiments, sell their Copilot product: https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1krttqo/my_new_hobby_watching_ai_slowly_drive_microsoft/
- Decentralisation are good, walled gardens are bad

# Conclusion

Diversity means sustainability.
It is good in the long run for everybody.
Not just in economical and ecological systems but also in the software ecosystem.
